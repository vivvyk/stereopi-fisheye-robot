StereoPi fisheye robot tutorial scripts
===========

Set of StereoPi Fisheye Robot tutorial scripts for StereoPi board with CM3/3+ inside.

Was tested in the following environment:
* Raspbian Buster (kernel 4.19.57-v7+)
* Python 3.7.3 
* OpenCV 3.4.3 (pre-compiled, 'pip' from Python Wheels)
* Picamera 1.13

### Critical notice!
In the latest Raspbian kernels stereoscopic support has been occasionally broken by implementing new AWB algorithm. You can read some more details [here](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1253). Our Raspbian image provided has no such a problem, but you can get it after 'apt-get upgrade' or 'rpi-update'.
Current solution: after boot run once this command before accessing your cameras:
```
sudo vcdbg set awb_mode 0
```
This will turn AWB algo to the previous mode, and stereo works again untill next reboot. So run this command after reboot, or add it to your autorun script.

### Brief scripts description:

**1_test.py** - starts camera preview, save captured image if 'Q' button is pressed. 
align.

**2_chess_cycle.py** - takes a series of photos for stereopair calibration, shows count
down timer. You need a printed chessboard with 9x6 parameters (file "pattern.png" included).

**3_pairs_cut.py** - just cuts all captured photos to left and right images.

**4_calibration_fisheye.py** - calibrate StereoPi cameas setup using pairs from script 4.

**5_dm_tune.py** - script for fine tune of disparity map settings.

**6_dm_video.py** - builds disparity map in real time.


**7_2d_map.py** - builds 2D map from the depth map.
